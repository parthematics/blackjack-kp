# Design Document
The following is the design document for my simple and intuitive Python implementation of traditional Blackjack.

## Running the Game ##
To run the game in terminal, simply navigate to the directory where the code was downloaded and run the command `python3 game.py`. This should call the main function in the Python file and start up a new game of Blackjack. To execute specific actions (hit/stand), follow the instructions provided on the terminal output. This game is user-input based, meaning that you must type directly into the console to specify which actions you would like to make. 

Instructions for running your code and any tests you may have written
Rules for your card game, if not one of the three listed above
A brief explanation of your design choices and any data structures or algorithms that you implemented
Choice of tooling (language, libraries, test runner, etc.) and rationale behind those choices.
