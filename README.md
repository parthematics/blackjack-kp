# Design Document
The following is the design document for my simple and intuitive Python implementation of traditional Blackjack.

## Running the Game ##
To run the game in terminal, simply navigate to the directory where the code was downloaded and run the command `python3 game.py`. This should call the main function in the Python file and start up a new game of Blackjack.

Instructions for running your code and any tests you may have written
Rules for your card game, if not one of the three listed above
A brief explanation of your design choices and any data structures or algorithms that you implemented
Choice of tooling (language, libraries, test runner, etc.) and rationale behind those choices.
